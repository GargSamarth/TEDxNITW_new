                        his recent hit. It caused waves of sentiment and controversy in it's wake.

                        fire is the solution. He is an exceptional mind with the talent to portray 
                        real emotions and stories, which establish a connect with the audience 
                        while simultaneously communicating thought provoking ideas. </p>
